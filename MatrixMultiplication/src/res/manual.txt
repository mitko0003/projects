Usage: MatrixMultiplication [-options] args(3)
           (last arg is used for destination file)

where options include:
    -g            use general definition of the matrix product
    -p [<int>]    use multi thread multiplication with <int> number of threads
                  by default uses current machine core count 0 < <int> <= 2*cores
    -b [<int>]    benchmark the multiplication with <int> passes using current
                  multiplication algorithm settings
                  by default makes one pass
    -w [<int>]    (Watch) print/log info about the multiplication tasks
                  <int> indicates the report frequency <int> > 0
    -h            get help
